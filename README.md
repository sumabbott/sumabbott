- 👋 Hi, I’m @sumabbott! I'm back on GitHub to play with new tech, have fun with code and contribute to open-source projects. 
- 👀 I’m interested in event drivent architecture, pub/sub patterns with TypeScript and Go to play with data in real time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new design patterns, architecture and systems to discover more about the problems they solve.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on TypeScript, React, Go, Bash and Python projects!
